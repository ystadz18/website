  <h1><a name="story">Quick story</a></h1>
 <p>There was once a man, he was a pro fisherman and every morning he would catch tons and tons of fish.So with all these fish in hand and years under his belt of experiance, he saw this pauper begging for food. So the fisherman decided he's going to teach this  man how to fish. Finaly after weeks of training him the pauper learnt the trade and was pretty skilled at it to. The pauper then looks  the fisherman in the eye and says instead of teachig me all this, taking all the time out of your day, why didnt you just throw me a  couple of fish out of the houndreds you have and call it a day. The fisherman then chuckles and looks at his student and says  <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/08/28/fish/" target="_blank">"I could give you some fish and feed you for the day or rather, I can teach you to fish and feed you for life".</a></p>

<div class="about">
 <h2><a name="about">About</a></h2>
      <p>-My name is Ysroel Stadler and i'm the developer of this website. I learnt everyhting for this website when I was 18 years old, and  was able to learn and create this website within 6 months.The way I learnt html/css and javascript was through a popular programing website online called <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">"teamtreehouse".</a> In addition to that online course over the summer to obtain further information on this I took a 4 and a half hour course by a youtuber named bucky, through his course on<a href="https://thenewboston.com" target="_blank">"Thenewboston".</a>So with all this information I was thinking to myself what I an do with all this information, and that's how this website came to be.</p>

<div class="motivation">
<h3><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></h3>
      <p>I feel there are 2 types of motivation one that's internal which comes from inside you, and one is external from something you see or watch. for me persoanlly i love motivation i feel its a key part of life, because if you dont motivate yourself and push yourself to do things you wont accomplish. The best example for me to give is working out, i really enjoy doing it and seeing results, even thoughh they are not instant. Working out is such a perfect example because this is something that needs a ton of 1.motivation, 2.practice, 3.consistancy, 4.learning, 5.time, and 6.patience, and i belive if you can apply these 6 things to anything you do in life you will be succeed in it.</p>
